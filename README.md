# WebSocketChatApplication

WebSocketChatApplication is a simple web aplication based on web sockets in ASP.NET Core without SignalR. 
The project uses Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebSockets package.

WebSocket (RFC 6455) is a protocol that enables two-way persistent communication channels over TCP connections. 
It's used in apps that benefit from fast, real-time communication, such as chat, dashboard, and game apps.
